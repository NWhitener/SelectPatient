preprocess is the suite necessary to preprocess a dataset for the DataMine Research Group. The method takes in a dataset, a labelset, and a number of optional parameters, and returns a dataset and labelset that contain a random male patient and a random female patient. This returned data can then be used to train the Feed Forward Neural Network. 


FFNN is the model building method. It creates a FFNN with a set of defined parameters. It will create an output file that houses the full suite of metrics supported by the model, as well as saving the object weights.
