# SelectPatient

SelectPatient is the first method in the suite necessary to preform a model federated learning example for the DataMine Research Group. The method takes in a dataset, a labelset, and a number of optional parameters, and returns a dataset and labelset that contain a random male patient and a random female patient. This returned data can then be used to train the Feed Forward Neural Network.
